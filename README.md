# Smart Recycling Using Deep Learning

### Overview
This project focuses on developing a **deep learning algorithm** to automatically differentiate between **recyclables** and **organic waste** using image classification. The goal is to optimize waste management by reducing the need for manual sorting and contributing to a more sustainable recycling process.

### Inputs and Outputs
- **Inputs**: Images of waste items, categorized as either recyclables or organics. The images can be sourced from mobile phones, freely available datasets (e.g., Kaggle), or manually captured.
- **Outputs**: A binary classification where:
  - **0**: Organic waste
  - **1**: Recyclable waste

### Target Classes
The waste items are divided into two main categories:

- **Organics**:
  - Food waste
  - Electronics
  - Plastic bags
  - Non-recyclable plastics
  - Rexins

- **Recyclables**:
  - Paper
  - Cardboard
  - Aluminium cans
  - Glass containers
  - Plastic bottles

### Dataset
- The dataset used for training and testing consists of images of both recyclables and organics. The dataset was sourced from **Kaggle**, and the link is ([kaggle datasets download -d techsash/waste-classification-data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data))
- **Training Set**: 22,000 images
- **Testing Set**: 2,000 images

### Model Training and Testing
- The deep learning model was trained using a dataset of 22,000 images, while 2,000 images were reserved for testing to ensure the model generalizes well.
- The dataset used is already labeled, so no manual labeling was required for this project.

### Evaluation Criteria
The performance of the model will be evaluated based on:
- **Accuracy**: The model should achieve an accuracy of over 75%.
- **Training Loss**: Low training loss indicates the model is learning the patterns in the data.
- **Validation Accuracy and Loss**: High validation accuracy with minimal validation loss signifies that the model is generalizing well to unseen data.

### Technology Stack
- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow or PyTorch
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - OpenCV for image processing
  - Numpy, Pandas for data manipulation
  - TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning model development

### Conclusion
This project leverages deep learning to automate the process of sorting waste into recyclables and organics. By developing a highly accurate model, the solution aims to contribute to a more sustainable environment by improving recycling efficiency and reducing manual labor in waste management.
